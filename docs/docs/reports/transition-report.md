### Is the product complete? Which parts are done and which aren’t done?  
The product is functionally complete, with core gameplay mechanics fully implemented, including hosting/joining multiplayer sessions, card interactions, and a working build. Documentation, such as the README and backlogs, is in place, covering setup and project structure. Some potential future features (like MVP4/MVP5 expansions) weren’t prioritized, but the current version delivers a polished, playable experience.  

### Is the customer using the product? How often? In what way? If not, why not?  
The customer hasn’t integrated the product into regular use, primarily due to their unfamiliarity with Godot—the engine powering the game. While they tested the build successfully, their long-term engagement would require adapting to Godot, which isn’t aligned with their current interests (they prefer tabletop or other engines).  

### Has the customer deployed the product on their side?  
They’ve accessed the build via GitHub Actions but noted the deployment process could be more user-friendly for non-technical users. Minor tweaks to the README (e.g., clearer artifact download instructions) would streamline this.  

### What measures need to be taken to fully transition the product?  
To ease transition, the team could:  
- Refine the README with simpler setup steps and a gameplay guide.  
- Add a quick-reference rulesheet (embedded or separate).  
- Provide a pre-packaged executable for one-click launches.  

### What are the customer’s plans for the product after delivery?  
The customer appreciates the team’s work but doesn’t plan to continue development in Godot. They’d consider collaboration if the project shifted to tabletop or a different engine.  

### How to increase the chance that it’ll be useful after final delivery?  
Ensuring the game is easily deployable and well-documented (e.g., adding a gameplay tutorial or video demo) would boost its longevity. A standalone HTML guide (as the customer suggested) could further enhance accessibility.  

### Customer feedback on your README: Is everything clear?  
The README is thorough but could simplify:  
- Replace technical terms like "latest green run" with plain language (e.g., "Download the latest stable build here").  
- Remove informal jokes to maintain professionalism.  

### Are they able to launch/deploy using your instructions?  
Yes, though the process required minor troubleshooting. Clearer labeling in GitHub Actions (e.g., "Download Game Build") would help.  

### What two other sections should be added to the README?  
1. Quickstart Guide: A step-by-step gameplay primer (how to host/join, basic rules).  
2. Future Roadmap: Briefly outline unrealized ideas (MVP4/MVP5) for inspiration.
